The parameter server is a distributed system scaling to industry size machine
learning problems. It provides asynchronous and zero-copy key-value pair
communications between worker machines and server machines. It also supports
flexible data consistency model, data filters, and flexible server machine
programming.


Fix acoording to Mli's parameter server to support large scale logsitic regression both in online and batch mode.
